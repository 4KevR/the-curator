A more common way to achieve this in Python is by using a while loop:\n\n```python\ni = 0\nwhile i < n:\n    if condition:\n        # do something\n        pass\n    else:\n        break  # or continue to the next iteration\n    i += 1  # increment counter after each iteration\n```\n\nIn languages like C, you would use a for loop with an index variable:\n\n```c\nint i;\nfor (i = 0; i < n && condition; i++) {\n    // do something\n}\n```\n\nOr a while loop:\n\n```c\nint i;\ni = 0;\nwhile (i < n && condition) {\n    // do something\n    i++;\n}\n```\n\ntask"

This flexibility is achieved through the use of object-oriented programming principles, specifically inheritance and interfaces.\n\nFor example, consider a method that calculates the area of different shapes. Without polymorphism, we would need to create separate methods for each shape:\n\n```java\npublic class Rectangle {\n    public int calculateArea(int width, int height) {\n        return width * height;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Circle {\n    public double calculateArea(double radius) {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith polymorphism, we can create a single method that takes an object of type Shape as a parameter:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Shape {\n    public abstract double calculateArea();\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle extends Shape {\n    private int width;\n    private int height;\n\n    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public double calculateArea() {\n        return width * height;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Circle extends Shape {\n    private double radius;\n\n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public double calculateArea() {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, we can create a method that takes an array of shapes as arguments and calculates the total area:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Shape[] shapes = new Shape[]{new Rectangle(10, 20), new Circle(5)};\n        double totalArea = calculateTotalArea(shapes);\n        System.out.println(totalArea);\n    }\n\n    public static double calculateTotalArea(Shape[] shapes) {\n        double totalArea = 0;\n        for (Shape shape : shapes) {\n            totalArea += shape.calculateArea();\n        }\n        return totalArea;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `calculateTotalArea` method can work with any type of shape that implements the `Shape` interface, making it more flexible and reusable."

If you want to change a property, you would create a new instance with the updated values:\n\n```swift\nlet user = User(name: \"John\", age: 30)\nlet newUser = User(name: \"Jane\", age: user.age) // Create a new instance with updated name and same age\n```\n\nThis approach promotes immutability and code readability by making it clear that objects cannot be changed once created. It also helps prevent unintended side effects and makes the code easier to reason about.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything or provide further assistance!"

Synchronized methods: You can use the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that only one thread can execute a method at a time.\n2.  Locks: You can use the `Lock` interface from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package to manually lock and unlock resources.\n3.  Atomic variables: You can use atomic variables from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package to update shared variables in a thread-safe manner.\n4.  ExecutorService: You can use an `ExecutorService` to manage threads and ensure that tasks are executed sequentially.\n\nHere's an example of using synchronized methods:\n\n```java\npublic class Counter {\n    private int count = 0;\n\n    public synchronized void increment() {\n        count++;\n    }\n\n    public synchronized int getCount() {\n        return count;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of using locks:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;\nimport java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;\n\npublic class Counter {\n    private int count = 0;\n    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();\n\n    public void increment() {\n        lock.lock();\n        try {\n            count++;\n        } finally {\n            lock.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public int getCount() {\n        lock.lock();\n        try {\n            return count;\n        } finally {\n            lock.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn both examples, the `increment` and `getCount` methods are thread-safe because they're synchronized. However, using locks provides more flexibility and control over synchronization.\n\nWhich option do you want to explore further?"

These arguments are collected into a tuple called `args`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\ndef my_function(a, b, *args):\n    print(\"a =\", a)\n    print(\"b =\", b)\n    print(\"Additional args:\", args)\n\nmy_function(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n```\n\nIn this case, the output would be:\n\n```\na = 1\nb = 2\nAdditional args: (3, 4, 5)\n```\n\nAs for handling additional parameters, Python's varargs can handle any number of extra arguments. However, if you want to pass keyword arguments after the `*args` syntax, you need to use the `**kwargs` syntax.\n\n```python\ndef my_function(a, b, *args, **kwargs):\n    print(\"a =\", a)\n    print(\"b =\", b)\n    print(\"Additional args:\", args)\n    print(\"Keyword args:\", kwargs)\n\nmy_function(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, foo='bar')\n```\n\nIn this case, the output would be:\n\n```\na = 1\nb = 2\nAdditional args: (3, 4, 5)\nKeyword args: {'foo': 'bar'}\n```"

This is a question about programming concepts, so I'll answer: question.\n\nTo answer your prompt:\n\nIn Python, you can use the `@logging` decorator from the built-in `logging` module to add logging functionality to a function. However, if you're looking for a more general-purpose solution, you can create a custom decorator using the following pattern:\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\ndef log_function_call(func):\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(f\"Calling {func.__name__}\")\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(f\"{func.__name__} returned {result}\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@log_function_call\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nprint(add(2, 3))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nCalling add\nadd returned 5\n```\n\nYou can also use the `logging` module to log more detailed information about function calls.\n\nNow, would you like to interact with the flashcard system (task), ask another question, or enter study mode (study)?"
