    "#\n",
    "# First, I need to find those cards. Since the task is about a concept rather than specific keywords, the best approach is to use the search_for_content function. This function uses an LLM to determine if a card's question or answer relates to the given topic. The prompt here would be \"object-oriented concepts\".\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But wait, I need to check which decks exist. If there are multiple decks, I should search across all of them. The user didn't specify a particular deck, so I should use the '*' as the deck_id_str in the search function. That way, it searches all decks.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Next, after creating the temporary collection with the relevant cards, I need to process each card. Since deleting all at once might be tricky, maybe I can list the cards in chunks and then delete them one by one. However, the system's functions allow adding all cards from a temporary collection to a deck, but here I need to delete them. So perhaps after getting the temporary collection, I can iterate through each card and call delete_card for each.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but how do I get the list of cards in the temporary collection? The function list_cards_temporary_collection returns a ChunkedCardStream, which gives batches of 5 cards. I can process each chunk, get the card IDs, and then delete them individually.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But the user's instruction is to delete all such cards. So steps would be:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. Use search_for_content with deck_id_str='*', search_prompt=\"object-oriented concepts\", searching in both question and answer.\n",
    "# 2. Get the temporary collection ID from the result.\n",
    "# 3. List the cards in this temporary collection using list_cards_temporary_collection, processing each chunk to get card IDs.\n",
    "# 4. For each card ID found, call delete_card with that ID.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But I need to make sure that all cards are processed. Also, if there are no cards found initially, maybe a fuzzy search is needed, but the user didn't mention that. However, since it's about concepts, maybe the initial search is sufficient. But the system's note says to use fuzzy search if substring search doesn't find anything. However, here we're using content-based search, not substring, so maybe it's okay.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, the search_for_content function uses an LLM to evaluate if the card talks about the topic. So that should handle variations in phrasing. So maybe no need for fuzzy here. But I'll proceed with the initial search.\n",

    "# First, I remember that in the previous steps, a temporary collection was created using search_for_content with the prompt \"object-oriented concepts\". That collection had 8 cards. Then, when listing the cards in chunks of 5, the first chunk showed 5 cards from the Java Programming deck. The user then deleted those 5 cards.

Since the system mentioned that after processing a chunk, if you want to continue, you return an empty execute block. But in this case, the assistant automatically proceeded to delete the next set without waiting. However, the response now is showing the result of the deletions for the first 5 cards.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but the user's last action was deleting those 5 cards, and the system responded with None for each. Now, I need to check if there are more cards in the temporary collection. Since the initial search found 8 cards, and the first chunk had 5, there should be another chunk of 3. The assistant needs to process those next.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But according to the instructions, after processing a chunk, you return an empty execute block to continue. However, in this case, the user's previous step was deleting the first 5, and now the system is indicating that those deletions were successful. Now, the next step would be to list the next chunk of cards from the temporary collection and delete them as well.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But how does the assistant know when there are more chunks? The list_cards_temporary_collection function returns a ChunkedCardStream, which is processed in batches of 5. So after the first 5, the next call would get the remaining 3. Therefore, the assistant should call list_cards_temporary_collection again to get the next chunk and then delete those cards.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# However, in the current state, the user's last action was deleting the first 5 cards, and the system responded with the None results. Now, the assistant needs to proceed to the next chunk.

    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but according to the execution details, if you need further information, you have to request it. However, in this case, the assistant is supposed to keep processing until all cards are deleted. So after deleting the first 5, the next step would be to list the remaining cards and delete them.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But looking back at the previous interaction, when the user deleted the first chunk, the system's response was [None, None, None, None, None], which indicates that those deletions were successful. Now, the assistant should check if there are more cards in the temporary collection to delete.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# So the next step is to call list_cards_temporary_collection again on the same temporary collection to get the next chunk of cards. Then, delete those remaining 3 cards.

However, in the previous steps, the user didn't specify the temporary collection's ID, so maybe the system automatically tracks it.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Alternatively, since the user hasn't mentioned any other temporary collections, the assistant can assume that the current one is the correct one. But how to reference it? The initial search_for_content would have returned a TemporaryCollection object with an ID. However, in the previous steps, the user didn't store that ID, so perhaps the system handles that internally.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but looking back at the functions available, the list_cards_temporary_collection function requires the temporary_collection_id_str. So the assistant needs to know the ID of the temporary collection created by search_for_content. However, in the initial steps, when the user ran search_for_content, the system would have returned a TemporaryCollection object with an ID. But how is that tracked?\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This is a bit confusing. Let me recap:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. The user's original command was to delete all cards about object-oriented concepts.\n",
    "# 2. The assistant first created a temporary collection via search_for_content(\"object-oriented concepts\", ...), which would return a TemporaryCollection with an ID, say tmp_collection_abc_def.\n",
    "# 3. Then, the assistant called list_cards_temporary_collection on that tmp_collection_abc_def to get chunks of cards.\n",
    "# 4. The first chunk had 5 cards, which were deleted.\n",
    "# 5. Now, the system needs to process the next chunk.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But in the current state, after deleting the first 5, the assistant must again call list_cards_temporary_collection with the same temporary collection ID to get the remaining cards. However, without knowing the ID of that temporary collection, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, there's a missing step here: tracking the temporary collection's ID.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But in the previous steps, when the user ran search_for_content, the function would have returned a TemporaryCollection object with an ID. However, since the system is stateless and each interaction is separate, the assistant needs to track that information. But how?\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, maybe the assistant should not assume that it has access to that information. Therefore, in this case, after creating the temporary collection via search_for_content, the assistant must store its ID for future reference. However, without knowing that, the assistant can't proceed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This is a problem. The initial steps would have involved:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - Calling search_for_content(...), which returns a TemporaryCollection with an ID.\n",
    "# - Then using that ID to list cards in the temporary collection.\n",
    "# - Then processing those cards.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But if the assistant didn't store the ID from the initial search, it can't proceed further. Therefore, there's a missing step here: the assistant must capture the ID of the temporary collection created by the search_for_content function.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# However, in the current setup, the functions are called one at a time, and each call is handled separately. So if the user hasn't provided any information about the temporary collection, the assistant might not know its ID.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This suggests that there's an error in the initial plan: after creating the temporary collection via search_for_content, the assistant should have stored its ID to use it later for listing cards. However, without knowing that, the assistant can't proceed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Therefore, the correct approach would be:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. Use search_for_content to create a temporary collection of cards about object-oriented concepts.\n",

    "# Wait, but in the example given earlier, when they used list_cards_temporary_collection, it returns chunks of 5 cards each. The user might have tried to call another list_cards while processing the first one, leading to the error. However, since there's no abort function, maybe the correct approach is to just not call list_cards again until the stream is done. But in this case, the user is trying to delete all matching cards, so they need to process all chunks.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Alternatively, perhaps the user should have processed all the chunks from the first list_cards_temporary_collection call before making another search. Since they tried to do a new search and got an error, maybe they need to finish processing the existing stream first.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but in their last attempt, after the exception, they tried to abort_card_stream(), which doesn't exist. The system correctly pointed out that the function isn't available. So the user is stuck because they can't exit the card stream, leading to errors when trying to perform another operation.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Hmm. Maybe the correct approach here is to realize that once a list_cards_temporary_collection is called, you have to process all chunks until it's done. If they want to stop, perhaps they need to ignore the remaining chunks, but the system doesn't support aborting. So maybe the user should proceed with processing the current stream first.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But in their case, after deleting the first batch of cards (5), the temporary collection still has 3 cards left. They tried to search again, which caused a conflict. The correct step would be to continue processing the existing card stream. However, since the system doesn't have an abort function, the user might need to handle it by continuing with the current stream.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but in their last interaction, after deleting the first 5 cards, they did another search_for_content, which created a new temporary collection. Then they tried to list_cards on that new one while still in the previous stream, causing the error. So maybe the solution is not to create a new temporary collection but to continue processing the existing one.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Alternatively, perhaps the user should have processed all chunks from the first search before doing another search. Since each call to list_cards_temporary_collection returns a chunked stream, they need to handle each chunk sequentially.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In this case, after the initial search_for_content created a temporary collection with the relevant cards, they would need to call list_cards_temporary_collection on that collection, process each batch of 5 cards, delete them one by one, and continue until all are deleted. However, since the user is trying to delete all at once, maybe there's a better way.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But given the system's constraints, the only way is to use search_for_content, get the temporary collection, list all cards in chunks, then for each chunk, delete the cards individually. Since the user can't abort the stream, they have to proceed with the existing one.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# So, the correct next step would be to process the remaining cards from the first temporary collection (after deleting the initial 5). However, since the user tried a new search and got into an error, perhaps they should continue working on the original temporary collection.\n",

    "#\n",

    "#\n",
    "# But first, let's start with creating the temporary collection using search_for_content. Let me check the parameters again: deck_id_str is '*', search_prompt is \"object-oriented concepts\", search_in_question and search_in_answer both True. That should gather all relevant cards.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Once that's done, I can proceed to delete each card in the temporary collection. However, I need to handle each card individually since there's no bulk delete function.

    "#\n",
