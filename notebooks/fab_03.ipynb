This method is meant to provide a single answer\\n        to a question, not a set of cards.\\n        \\n\\n## Execution Details\\n\\nFirst, you **have to** think about what the user wants, which information you need, and make a rough plan of your actions. Almost always you will need further information (e.g., deck ids, card ids, or card content). In this case, you will request the information using the functions at your disposal.\\nHowever, please **be concise while thinking**. Do not spend much time.\\n**Only** execute what the user asks you to. Do not perform further tasks. If you are tasked to create a deck, you create a deck, and not anything else like additional cards.\\nAfter reasoning, output the steps you want to execute **now** in the following format:\\n\\n<execute>\\n* function_call_1(arguments)\\n* function_call_2(arguments)\\n...\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system will then execute your commands, and return an python array of results:\\n[\"result_of_call_1\", \"result_of_call_2\", ...]\\n\\nIf no further actions are needed, please return an empty execute block:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\n## User-Facing Responses\\n\\nIf you want to directly respond to the user and end the execution (for example, to summarize results, provide a final answer, or bundle output for the user), you can return a response block in the following format:\\n\\n<response>\\nYour message to the user goes here. This will be shown as the final output and end the execution. The response should only be used for whatever response comes from respond_to_question_answering_query. So wrap the response of this tool in the <response>...</response> block.\\n</response>\\n\\nIf a <response>...</response> block is present, the system will return its content to the user and stop further execution.\\n\\n## Further Instructions\\nThere are a few special cases:\\n* If the prompt does not specify which deck to operate on, please check (by listing the decks) if only one deck exists. In this case, please use this deck. In this case, do not generate a default deck.\\n* Some prompts may contain questions and answers in quotation marks, some prompts may not. Please remove those quotation marks. E.g. if the user wants you to:\\n Create a card with question \"What is the most common pet in Germany?\" and answer \"Dogs\".\\n You should **not** include these quotation marks in the card.\\n* If the user asks you to find cards about a topic, use the right function. If you have a given or obvious keyword, use functions like search_for_substring. If the user asks about an concept, please use methods like search_for_content instead, that actually evaluate the content of the query and the cards.\\n* If you performed a substring search and found no cards, please always try a fuzzy search! So single-letter mistakes or punctuation do not prevent you from finding the correct card.\\n* If your job is to edit/delete all cards that are related to a specific topic / have a certain keyword, your steps are:\\n  * 1. Create a temporary collection of the relevant cards using search_by_substring or search_by_content. Fuzzy-search is your friend; use it!\\n  * 2. List the cards in the temporary collection to get a card stream.\\n  * 3. You will be provided with chunks of cards; now it is your job to work with these chunks: Delete, edit, etc. the card according to your task.\\n* If a user is asking a general question which may be included on some card, use the respond_to_question_answering_query function which returns an answer that can be given back to the user. Do not use the previously mentioned search functions when the user just asks a question that expects a natural answer (and not e.g. a set of cards where you would require the previous functions.).\\n  \\nIf you are not sure what to do, and you are sure that the user forgot to specify some specifics, please call the above-mentioned function to request further information from the user.\\n\\n## An Example\\nFor example, if the user prompt was:\\n\"Create a new deck with the name Astrology\"\\nYour steps should be:\\n* Create a new deck with the name Astrology. Wait for the output to get the id of this new deck.\\n* Add a card with the given question, answer and flag to the deck.\\n\\nSo the first execution plan would be:\\n<execute>\\n* create_deck(\"Astrology\")\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system then would answer you the information of the newly created deck, e.g.:\\n[\"Deck \\'Astrology\\' (id: deck_9874_2787)\"]\\n\\nThe system then provides you with an empty response.\\nThen, you have achieved your task, and return:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\nWhen previously the respond_to_question_answering_query was called and now the context is available, generate a response block duplicating the retrieved content. Do not generate an answer with your own knowledge, use it only after respond_to_question_answering_query.\\n\\n<response>\\n(# Answer here)\\n</response>\\n\\nRemember to not generate arbitrary cards in you execution plan, but only those that were asked for by the user prompt.\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?'}]\n",

This method is meant to provide a single answer\\n        to a question, not a set of cards.\\n        \\n\\n## Execution Details\\n\\nFirst, you **have to** think about what the user wants, which information you need, and make a rough plan of your actions. Almost always you will need further information (e.g., deck ids, card ids, or card content). In this case, you will request the information using the functions at your disposal.\\nHowever, please **be concise while thinking**. Do not spend much time.\\n**Only** execute what the user asks you to. Do not perform further tasks. If you are tasked to create a deck, you create a deck, and not anything else like additional cards.\\nAfter reasoning, output the steps you want to execute **now** in the following format:\\n\\n<execute>\\n* function_call_1(arguments)\\n* function_call_2(arguments)\\n...\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system will then execute your commands, and return an python array of results:\\n[\"result_of_call_1\", \"result_of_call_2\", ...]\\n\\nIf no further actions are needed, please return an empty execute block:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\n## User-Facing Responses\\n\\nIf you want to directly respond to the user and end the execution (for example, to summarize results, provide a final answer, or bundle output for the user), you can return a response block in the following format:\\n\\n<response>\\nYour message to the user goes here. This will be shown as the final output and end the execution. The response should only be used for whatever response comes from respond_to_question_answering_query. So wrap the response of this tool in the <response>...</response> block.\\n</response>\\n\\nIf a <response>...</response> block is present, the system will return its content to the user and stop further execution.\\n\\n## Further Instructions\\nThere are a few special cases:\\n* If the prompt does not specify which deck to operate on, please check (by listing the decks) if only one deck exists. In this case, please use this deck. In this case, do not generate a default deck.\\n* Some prompts may contain questions and answers in quotation marks, some prompts may not. Please remove those quotation marks. E.g. if the user wants you to:\\n Create a card with question \"What is the most common pet in Germany?\" and answer \"Dogs\".\\n You should **not** include these quotation marks in the card.\\n* If the user asks you to find cards about a topic, use the right function. If you have a given or obvious keyword, use functions like search_for_substring. If the user asks about an concept, please use methods like search_for_content instead, that actually evaluate the content of the query and the cards.\\n* If you performed a substring search and found no cards, please always try a fuzzy search! So single-letter mistakes or punctuation do not prevent you from finding the correct card.\\n* If your job is to edit/delete all cards that are related to a specific topic / have a certain keyword, your steps are:\\n  * 1. Create a temporary collection of the relevant cards using search_by_substring or search_by_content. Fuzzy-search is your friend; use it!\\n  * 2. List the cards in the temporary collection to get a card stream.\\n  * 3. You will be provided with chunks of cards; now it is your job to work with these chunks: Delete, edit, etc. the card according to your task.\\n* If a user is asking a general question which may be included on some card, use the respond_to_question_answering_query function which returns an answer that can be given back to the user. Do not use the previously mentioned search functions when the user just asks a question that expects a natural answer (and not e.g. a set of cards where you would require the previous functions.).\\n  \\nIf you are not sure what to do, and you are sure that the user forgot to specify some specifics, please call the above-mentioned function to request further information from the user.\\n\\n## An Example\\nFor example, if the user prompt was:\\n\"Create a new deck with the name Astrology\"\\nYour steps should be:\\n* Create a new deck with the name Astrology. Wait for the output to get the id of this new deck.\\n* Add a card with the given question, answer and flag to the deck.\\n\\nSo the first execution plan would be:\\n<execute>\\n* create_deck(\"Astrology\")\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system then would answer you the information of the newly created deck, e.g.:\\n[\"Deck \\'Astrology\\' (id: deck_9874_2787)\"]\\n\\nThe system then provides you with an empty response.\\nThen, you have achieved your task, and return:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\nWhen previously the respond_to_question_answering_query was called and now the context is available, generate a response block duplicating the retrieved content. Do not generate an answer with your own knowledge, use it only after respond_to_question_answering_query.\\n\\n<response>\\n(# Answer here)\\n</response>\\n\\nRemember to not generate arbitrary cards in you execution plan, but only those that were asked for by the user prompt.\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?'}]\n",

Almost always you will need further information (e.g., deck ids, card ids, or card content). In this case, you will request the information using the functions at your disposal.\\nHowever, please **be concise while thinking**. Do not spend much time.\\n**Only** execute what the user asks you to. Do not perform further tasks. If you are tasked to create a deck, you create a deck, and not anything else like additional cards.\\nAfter reasoning, output the steps you want to execute **now** in the following format:\\n\\n<execute>\\n* function_call_1(arguments)\\n* function_call_2(arguments)\\n...\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system will then execute your commands, and return an python array of results:\\n[\"result_of_call_1\", \"result_of_call_2\", ...]\\n\\nIf no further actions are needed, please return an empty execute block:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\n## User-Facing Responses\\n\\nIf you want to directly respond to the user and end the execution (for example, to summarize results, provide a final answer, or bundle output for the user), you can return a response block in the following format:\\n\\n<response>\\nYour message to the user goes here. This will be shown as the final output and end the execution. The response should only be used for whatever response comes from respond_to_question_answering_query. So wrap the response of this tool in the <response>...</response> block.\\n</response>\\n\\nIf a <response>...</response> block is present, the system will return its content to the user and stop further execution.\\n\\n## Further Instructions\\nThere are a few special cases:\\n* If the prompt does not specify which deck to operate on, please check (by listing the decks) if only one deck exists. In this case, please use this deck. In this case, do not generate a default deck.\\n* Some prompts may contain questions and answers in quotation marks, some prompts may not. Please remove those quotation marks. E.g. if the user wants you to:\\n Create a card with question \"What is the most common pet in Germany?\" and answer \"Dogs\".\\n You should **not** include these quotation marks in the card.\\n* If the user asks you to find cards about a topic, use the right function. If you have a given or obvious keyword, use functions like search_for_substring. If the user asks about an concept, please use methods like search_for_content instead, that actually evaluate the content of the query and the cards.\\n* If you performed a substring search and found no cards, please always try a fuzzy search! So single-letter mistakes or punctuation do not prevent you from finding the correct card.\\n* If your job is to edit/delete all cards that are related to a specific topic / have a certain keyword, your steps are:\\n  * 1. Create a temporary collection of the relevant cards using search_by_substring or search_by_content. Fuzzy-search is your friend; use it!\\n  * 2. List the cards in the temporary collection to get a card stream.\\n  * 3. You will be provided with chunks of cards; now it is your job to work with these chunks: Delete, edit, etc. the card according to your task.\\n* If a user is asking a general question which may be included on some card, use the respond_to_question_answering_query function which returns an answer that can be given back to the user. Do not use the previously mentioned search functions when the user just asks a question that expects a natural answer (and not e.g. a set of cards where you would require the previous functions.).\\n  \\nIf you are not sure what to do, and you are sure that the user forgot to specify some specifics, please call the above-mentioned function to request further information from the user.\\n\\n## An Example\\nFor example, if the user prompt was:\\n\"Create a new deck with the name Astrology\"\\nYour steps should be:\\n* Create a new deck with the name Astrology. Wait for the output to get the id of this new deck.\\n* Add a card with the given question, answer and flag to the deck.\\n\\nSo the first execution plan would be:\\n<execute>\\n* create_deck(\"Astrology\")\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system then would answer you the information of the newly created deck, e.g.:\\n[\"Deck \\'Astrology\\' (id: deck_9874_2787)\"]\\n\\nThe system then provides you with an empty response.\\nThen, you have achieved your task, and return:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\nWhen previously the respond_to_question_answering_query was called and now the context is available, generate a response block duplicating the retrieved content. Do not generate an answer with your own knowledge, use it only after respond_to_question_answering_query.\\n\\n<response>\\n(# Answer here)\\n</response>\\n\\nRemember to not generate arbitrary cards in you execution plan, but only those that were asked for by the user prompt.\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<think>\\nFirst, the user is asking a general question: \"How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?\" This is a straightforward question about programming concepts.\\n\\nAccording to the instructions, if the user asks a general question that might be included on some card or requires an answer, I should use the respond_to_question_answering_query function. This is because it\\'s not a specific search for cards, but rather an answer to provide based on knowledge or by querying the system.\\n\\nThe respond_to_question_answering_query function is described as: \"Responds to a question from the user about available content in the SRS.\" It\\'s for when general question answering is requested, not limited to searching for cards.\\n\\nIn this case, the user\\'s prompt does not specify any decks or cards directly. It\\'s a general knowledge question.\\n\\nThe instructions say: \"If a user is asking a general question which may be included on some card, use the respond_to_question_answering_query function.\" It also says: \"Do not use this method for specific searches, e.g. searching for a keyword or topic.\"\\n\\nHere, the question is about a programming concept that could be on a card in some deck, but it\\'s not specified which deck. However, the priority is to answer directly if possible.\\n\\nMoreover, in the example given earlier, when a question needs answering, use respond_to_question_answering_query.\\n\\nI don\\'t need to perform any actions like searching for decks or cards because the user didn\\'t ask for anything specific. The question itself can be answered without interacting with decks.\\n\\nIn the respond_to_question_answering_query function, I should call it to get an answer.\\n\\nBut according to the response format, if I use respond_to_question_answering_query, it will return an answer that should be wrapped in a <response> block.\\n\\nReading the instructions: \"If you want to directly respond to the user and end the execution, you can return a response block.\"\\n\\nAnd specifically for this function: \"the method will try to answer the question, and you should return its response.\"\\n\\nIn this case, I don\\'t need to execute any steps; I can directly output the response if possible.\\n\\nBut in this simulation, I am reasoning now, and then executing or responding.\\n\\nSince the user asked a question, I should call respond_to_question_answering_query.\\n\\nBut in my response format, after executing and getting results, I can include them in a <response> block.\\n\\nPerhaps the best way is to assume that the system has some cards, and I should query it.\\n\\nSince this is a standalone interaction, and no decks are mentioned, but the function might work based on available content.\\n\\nTo keep it simple, I should use respond_to_question_answering_query and then enclose the answer in a <response> block.\\n\\nBut according to the instructions: \"If a <response>...</response> block is present, the system will return its content to the user and stop further execution.\"\\n\\nAnd \"the response should only be used for whatever response comes from respond_to_question_answering_query.\"\\n\\nSo, in this case, I need to call the function.\\n\\nBut first, I need to output my execution plan in <execute> tags.\\n\\nSo, for this prompt, the correct action is to call respond_to_question_answering_query with the search prompt.\\n\\nThe user asked: \"How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?\"\\n\\nSo, I should call: respond_to_question_answering_query(\"How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?\")\\n\\nThen, after that, if there\\'s a response, I return it.\\n\\nIn the code execution plan, I need to have an <execute> block with this function call.\\n\\nThen, the system would execute it and return [\"some answer\"], and then I should output a <response> with that answer.\\n\\nBut in this simulation, since I\\'m reasoning now, I need to output the <execute> block.\\n\\nAlso, note that this function might not be designed for general questions, but according to the prompt, it is.\\n\\nLooking back: \"respond_to_question_answering_query(search_prompt: str) -> str\"\\n\\nSo it takes a string and returns an answer.\\n\\nTherefore, for this query, I should call this function.\\n\\nNow, about decks: the user didn\\'t specify any decks, and it\\'s not a search query in terms of cards. It\\'s more like asking for information.\\n\\nBut according to instructions: \"if you want to directly respond, use response block.\"\\n\\nIn this case, I should perform the function call.\\n\\nFinally, output format:\\n\\n<execute>\\n* respond_to_question_answering_query(\"How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?\")\\n</execute>\\n\\nThen, after execution, I receive the answer, and output it with <response>.\\n\\nSince this is a reasoning step, I need to have that.\\n\\nAlso, remember not to generate arbitrary cards; only what\\'s asked.\\n\\nHere, no decks or cards are involved in the prompt.\\n</think>\\nThe user has asked a general question regarding programming concepts, which falls under the scope of using `respond_to_question_answering_query` for answer generation.

E.g. if the user wants you to:\\n Create a card with question \"What is the most common pet in Germany?\" and answer \"Dogs\".\\n You should **not** include these quotation marks in the card.\\n* If the user asks you to find cards about a topic, use the right function. If you have a given or obvious keyword, use functions like search_for_substring. If the user asks about an concept, please use methods like search_for_content instead, that actually evaluate the content of the query and the cards.\\n* If you performed a substring search and found no cards, please always try a fuzzy search! So single-letter mistakes or punctuation do not prevent you from finding the correct card.\\n* If your job is to edit/delete all cards that are related to a specific topic / have a certain keyword, your steps are:\\n  * 1. Create a temporary collection of the relevant cards using search_by_substring or search_by_content. Fuzzy-search is your friend; use it!\\n  * 2. List the cards in the temporary collection to get a card stream.\\n  * 3. You will be provided with chunks of cards; now it is your job to work with these chunks: Delete, edit, etc. the card according to your task.\\n* If a user is asking a general question which may be included on some card, use the respond_to_question_answering_query function which returns an answer that can be given back to the user. Do not use the previously mentioned search functions when the user just asks a question that expects a natural answer (and not e.g. a set of cards where you would require the previous functions.).\\n  \\nIf you are not sure what to do, and you are sure that the user forgot to specify some specifics, please call the above-mentioned function to request further information from the user.\\n\\n## An Example\\nFor example, if the user prompt was:\\n\"Create a new deck with the name Astrology\"\\nYour steps should be:\\n* Create a new deck with the name Astrology. Wait for the output to get the id of this new deck.\\n* Add a card with the given question, answer and flag to the deck.\\n\\nSo the first execution plan would be:\\n<execute>\\n* create_deck(\"Astrology\")\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system then would answer you the information of the newly created deck, e.g.:\\n[\"Deck \\'Astrology\\' (id: deck_9874_2787)\"]\\n\\nThe system then provides you with an empty response.\\nThen, you have achieved your task, and return:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\nWhen previously the respond_to_question_answering_query was called and now the context is available, generate a response block duplicating the retrieved content. Do not generate an answer with your own knowledge, use it only after respond_to_question_answering_query.\\n\\n<response>\\n(# Answer here)\\n</response>\\n\\nRemember to not generate arbitrary cards in you execution plan, but only those that were asked for by the user prompt.\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<think>\\nFirst, the user is asking a general question: \"How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?\" This is a straightforward question about programming concepts.\\n\\nAccording to the instructions, if the user asks a general question that might be included on some card or requires an answer, I should use the respond_to_question_answering_query function. This is because it\\'s not a specific search for cards, but rather an answer to provide based on knowledge or by querying the system.\\n\\nThe respond_to_question_answering_query function is described as: \"Responds to a question from the user about available content in the SRS.\" It\\'s for when general question answering is requested, not limited to searching for cards.\\n\\nIn this case, the user\\'s prompt does not specify any decks or cards directly. It\\'s a general knowledge question.\\n\\nThe instructions say: \"If a user is asking a general question which may be included on some card, use the respond_to_question_answering_query function.\" It also says: \"Do not use this method for specific searches, e.g. searching for a keyword or topic.\"\\n\\nHere, the question is about a programming concept that could be on a card in some deck, but it\\'s not specified which deck. However, the priority is to answer directly if possible.\\n\\nMoreover, in the example given earlier, when a question needs answering, use respond_to_question_answering_query.\\n\\nI don\\'t need to perform any actions like searching for decks or cards because the user didn\\'t ask for anything specific. The question itself can be answered without interacting with decks.\\n\\nIn the respond_to_question_answering_query function, I should call it to get an answer.\\n\\nBut according to the response format, if I use respond_to_question_answering_query, it will return an answer that should be wrapped in a <response> block.\\n\\nReading the instructions: \"If you want to directly respond to the user and end the execution, you can return a response block.\"\\n\\nAnd specifically for this function: \"the method will try to answer the question, and you should return its response.\"\\n\\nIn this case, I don\\'t need to execute any steps; I can directly output the response if possible.\\n\\nBut in this simulation, I am reasoning now, and then executing or responding.\\n\\nSince the user asked a question, I should call respond_to_question_answering_query.\\n\\nBut in my response format, after executing and getting results, I can include them in a <response> block.\\n\\nPerhaps the best way is to assume that the system has some cards, and I should query it.\\n\\nSince this is a standalone interaction, and no decks are mentioned, but the function might work based on available content.\\n\\nTo keep it simple, I should use respond_to_question_answering_query and then enclose the answer in a <response> block.\\n\\nBut according to the instructions: \"If a <response>...</response> block is present, the system will return its content to the user and stop further execution.\"\\n\\nAnd \"the response should only be used for whatever response comes from respond_to_question_answering_query.\"\\n\\nSo, in this case, I need to call the function.\\n\\nBut first, I need to output my execution plan in <execute> tags.\\n\\nSo, for this prompt, the correct action is to call respond_to_question_answering_query with the search prompt.\\n\\nThe user asked: \"How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?\"\\n\\nSo, I should call: respond_to_question_answering_query(\"How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?\")\\n\\nThen, after that, if there\\'s a response, I return it.\\n\\nIn the code execution plan, I need to have an <execute> block with this function call.\\n\\nThen, the system would execute it and return [\"some answer\"], and then I should output a <response> with that answer.\\n\\nBut in this simulation, since I\\'m reasoning now, I need to output the <execute> block.\\n\\nAlso, note that this function might not be designed for general questions, but according to the prompt, it is.\\n\\nLooking back: \"respond_to_question_answering_query(search_prompt: str) -> str\"\\n\\nSo it takes a string and returns an answer.\\n\\nTherefore, for this query, I should call this function.\\n\\nNow, about decks: the user didn\\'t specify any decks, and it\\'s not a search query in terms of cards. It\\'s more like asking for information.\\n\\nBut according to instructions: \"if you want to directly respond, use response block.\"\\n\\nIn this case, I should perform the function call.\\n\\nFinally, output format:\\n\\n<execute>\\n* respond_to_question_answering_query(\"How does the concept of uniqueness in sets differ from lists in Python?\")\\n</execute>\\n\\nThen, after execution, I receive the answer, and output it with <response>.\\n\\nSince this is a reasoning step, I need to have that.\\n\\nAlso, remember not to generate arbitrary cards; only what\\'s asked.\\n\\nHere, no decks or cards are involved in the prompt.\\n</think>\\nThe user has asked a general question regarding programming concepts, which falls under the scope of using `respond_to_question_answering_query` for answer generation.

Almost always you will need further information (e.g., deck ids, card ids, or card content). In this case, you will request the information using the functions at your disposal.\\nHowever, please **be concise while thinking**. Do not spend much time.\\n**Only** execute what the user asks you to. Do not perform further tasks. If you are tasked to create a deck, you create a deck, and not anything else like additional cards.\\nAfter reasoning, output the steps you want to execute **now** in the following format:\\n\\n<execute>\\n* function_call_1(arguments)\\n* function_call_2(arguments)\\n...\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system will then execute your commands, and return an python array of results:\\n[\"result_of_call_1\", \"result_of_call_2\", ...]\\n\\nIf no further actions are needed, please return an empty execute block:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\n## Further Instructions\\nThere are a few special cases:\\n* If the prompt does not specify which deck to operate on, please check (by listing the decks) if only one deck exists. In this case, please use this deck. In this case, do not generate a default deck.\\n* Some prompts may contain questions and answers in quotation marks, some prompts may not. Please remove those quotation marks. E.g. if the user wants you to:\\n Create a card with question \"What is the most common pet in Germany?\" and answer \"Dogs\".\\n You should **not** include these quotation marks in the card.\\n* If the user asks you to find cards about a topic, use the right function. If you have a given or obvious keyword, use functions like search_for_substring. If the user asks about an concept, please use methods like search_for_content instead, that actually evaluate the content of the query and the cards.\\n* If you performed a substring search and found no cards, please always try a fuzzy search! So single-letter mistakes or punctuation do not prevent you from finding the correct card.\\n* If your job is to edit/delete all cards that are related to a specific topic / have a certain keyword, your steps are:\\n  * 1. Create a temporary collection of the relevant cards using search_by_substring or search_by_content. Fuzzy-search is your friend; use it!\\n  * 2. List the cards in the temporary collection to get a card stream.\\n  * 3. You will be provided with chunks of cards; now it is your job to work with these chunks: Delete, edit, etc. the card according to your task.\\n* If a user is asking a general question which may be included on some card, use the respond_to_question_answering_query function which returns an answer that can be given back to the user. Do not use the previously mentioned search functions when the user just asks a question that expects a natural answer (and not e.g. a set of cards where you would require the previous functions.).\\n  \\nIf you are not sure what to do, and you are sure that the user forgot to specify some specifics, please call the above-mentioned function to request further information from the user.\\n\\n## An Example\\nFor example, if the user prompt was:\\n\"Create a new deck with the name Astrology\"\\nYour steps should be:\\n* Create a new deck with the name Astrology. Wait for the output to get the id of this new deck.\\n* Add a card with the given question, answer and flag to the deck.\\n\\nSo the first execution plan would be:\\n<execute>\\n* create_deck(\"Astrology\")\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system then would answer you the information of the newly created deck, e.g.:\\n[\"Deck \\'Astrology\\' (id: deck_9874_2787)\"]\\n\\nThe system then provides you with an empty response.\\nThen, you have achieved your task, and return:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\nRemeber to not generate arbitrary cards in you execution plan, but only those that were asked for by the user prompt.\\nEverytime you are done with generating the respective execution plan, stop your response by writing User:\"\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ['Which latin authors are in my deck?']}]\n"

This method is meant to provide a single answer\\n        to a question, not a set of cards.\\n        \\n\\n## Execution Details\\n\\nFirst, you **have to** think about what the user wants, which information you need, and make a rough plan of your actions. Almost always you will need further information (e.g., deck ids, card ids, or card content). In this case, you will request the information using the functions at your disposal.\\nHowever, please **be concise while thinking**. Do not spend much time.\\n**Only** execute what the user asks you to. Do not perform further tasks. If you are tasked to create a deck, you create a deck, and not anything else like additional cards.\\nAfter reasoning, output the steps you want to execute **now** in the following format:\\n\\n<execute>\\n* function_call_1(arguments)\\n* function_call_2(arguments)\\n...\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system will then execute your commands, and return an python array of results:\\n[\"result_of_call_1\", \"result_of_call_2\", ...]\\n\\nIf no further actions are needed, please return an empty execute block:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\n## Further Instructions\\nThere are a few special cases:\\n* If the prompt does not specify which deck to operate on, please check (by listing the decks) if only one deck exists. In this case, please use this deck. In this case, do not generate a default deck.\\n* Some prompts may contain questions and answers in quotation marks, some prompts may not. Please remove those quotation marks. E.g. if the user wants you to:\\n Create a card with question \"What is the most common pet in Germany?\" and answer \"Dogs\".\\n You should **not** include these quotation marks in the card.\\n* If the user asks you to find cards about a topic, use the right function. If you have a given or obvious keyword, use functions like search_for_substring. If the user asks about an concept, please use methods like search_for_content instead, that actually evaluate the content of the query and the cards.\\n* If you performed a substring search and found no cards, please always try a fuzzy search! So single-letter mistakes or punctuation do not prevent you from finding the correct card.\\n* If your job is to edit/delete all cards that are related to a specific topic / have a certain keyword, your steps are:\\n  * 1. Create a temporary collection of the relevant cards using search_by_substring or search_by_content. Fuzzy-search is your friend; use it!\\n  * 2. List the cards in the temporary collection to get a card stream.\\n  * 3. You will be provided with chunks of cards; now it is your job to work with these chunks: Delete, edit, etc. the card according to your task.\\n* If a user is asking a general question which may be included on some card, use the respond_to_question_answering_query function which returns an answer that can be given back to the user. Do not use the previously mentioned search functions when the user just asks a question that expects a natural answer (and not e.g. a set of cards where you would require the previous functions.).\\n  \\nIf you are not sure what to do, and you are sure that the user forgot to specify some specifics, please call the above-mentioned function to request further information from the user.\\n\\n## An Example\\nFor example, if the user prompt was:\\n\"Create a new deck with the name Astrology\"\\nYour steps should be:\\n* Create a new deck with the name Astrology. Wait for the output to get the id of this new deck.\\n* Add a card with the given question, answer and flag to the deck.\\n\\nSo the first execution plan would be:\\n<execute>\\n* create_deck(\"Astrology\")\\n</execute>\\n\\nThe system then would answer you the information of the newly created deck, e.g.:\\n[\"Deck \\'Astrology\\' (id: deck_9874_2787)\"]\\n\\nThe system then provides you with an empty response.\\nThen, you have achieved your task, and return:\\n\\n<execute>\\n</execute>\\n\\nRemeber to not generate arbitrary cards in you execution plan, but only those that were asked for by the user prompt.\\nEverytime you are done with generating the respective execution plan, stop your response by writing User:\"\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ['Which latin authors are in my deck?']}]\n",

    "#\n",
    "# First, I need to find those cards. Since the task is about a concept rather than specific keywords, the best approach is to use the search_for_content function. This function uses an LLM to determine if a card's question or answer relates to the given topic. The prompt here would be \"object-oriented concepts\".\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But wait, I need to check which decks exist. If there are multiple decks, I should search across all of them. The user didn't specify a particular deck, so I should use the '*' as the deck_id_str in the search function. That way, it searches all decks.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Next, after creating the temporary collection with the relevant cards, I need to process each card. Since deleting all at once might be tricky, maybe I can list the cards in chunks and then delete them one by one. However, the system's functions allow adding all cards from a temporary collection to a deck, but here I need to delete them. So perhaps after getting the temporary collection, I can iterate through each card and call delete_card for each.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but how do I get the list of cards in the temporary collection? The function list_cards_temporary_collection returns a ChunkedCardStream, which gives batches of 5 cards. I can process each chunk, get the card IDs, and then delete them individually.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But the user's instruction is to delete all such cards. So steps would be:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. Use search_for_content with deck_id_str='*', search_prompt=\"object-oriented concepts\", searching in both question and answer.\n",
    "# 2. Get the temporary collection ID from the result.\n",
    "# 3. List the cards in this temporary collection using list_cards_temporary_collection, processing each chunk to get card IDs.\n",
    "# 4. For each card ID found, call delete_card with that ID.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But I need to make sure that all cards are processed. Also, if there are no cards found initially, maybe a fuzzy search is needed, but the user didn't mention that. However, since it's about concepts, maybe the initial search is sufficient. But the system's note says to use fuzzy search if substring search doesn't find anything. However, here we're using content-based search, not substring, so maybe it's okay.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, the search_for_content function uses an LLM to evaluate if the card talks about the topic. So that should handle variations in phrasing. So maybe no need for fuzzy here. But I'll proceed with the initial search.\n",

Then, when listing the cards in chunks of 5, the first chunk showed 5 cards from the Java Programming deck. The user then deleted those 5 cards.

    "# But according to the instructions, after processing a chunk, you return an empty execute block to continue. However, in this case, the user's previous step was deleting the first 5, and now the system is indicating that those deletions were successful. Now, the next step would be to list the next chunk of cards from the temporary collection and delete them as well.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But how does the assistant know when there are more chunks? The list_cards_temporary_collection function returns a ChunkedCardStream, which is processed in batches of 5. So after the first 5, the next call would get the remaining 3. Therefore, the assistant should call list_cards_temporary_collection again to get the next chunk and then delete those cards.\n",

However, in the previous steps, the user didn't specify the temporary collection's ID, so maybe the system automatically tracks it.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Alternatively, since the user hasn't mentioned any other temporary collections, the assistant can assume that the current one is the correct one. But how to reference it?

However, in the initial steps, when the user ran search_for_content, the system would have returned a TemporaryCollection object with an ID. But how is that tracked?\n",

    "# Okay, let's see what the user is trying to do here. They want to delete all cards related to object-oriented concepts. From the previous interactions, they tried using search_for_content and then list_cards_temporary_collection, but ran into an error about being in an active card stream.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, the system mentioned that when you call list_cards_temporary_collection, it returns a ChunkedCardStream, which needs to be exited before starting another one. The user tried to call list_cards again while still in the stream, causing the exception. Then they attempted to abort the card stream, but the function name was incorrect. The system said \"Unknown function name abort_card_stream.\" So, maybe the correct function is different?\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Looking back at the available functions, there's no mention of an abort_card_stream function. The user might have assumed it exists based on previous steps, but according to the provided functions, there's no such thing. The only way to exit a card stream is by not calling list_cards_temporary_collection again until the current stream is exhausted or the user decides to stop.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but in the example given earlier, when they used list_cards_temporary_collection, it returns chunks of 5 cards each. The user might have tried to call another list_cards while processing the first one, leading to the error. However, since there's no abort function, maybe the correct approach is to just not call list_cards again until the stream is done. But in this case, the user is trying to delete all matching cards, so they need to process all chunks.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Alternatively, perhaps the user should have processed all the chunks from the first list_cards_temporary_collection call before making another search. Since they tried to do a new search and got an error, maybe they need to finish processing the existing stream first.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but in their last attempt, after the exception, they tried to abort_card_stream(), which doesn't exist. The system correctly pointed out that the function isn't available. So the user is stuck because they can't exit the card stream, leading to errors when trying to perform another operation.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Hmm. Maybe the correct approach here is to realize that once a list_cards_temporary_collection is called, you have to process all chunks until it's done. If they want to stop, perhaps they need to ignore the remaining chunks, but the system doesn't support aborting. So maybe the user should proceed with processing the current stream first.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But in their case, after deleting the first batch of cards (5), the temporary collection still has 3 cards left. They tried to search again, which caused a conflict. The correct step would be to continue processing the existing card stream. However, since the system doesn't have an abort function, the user might need to handle it by continuing with the current stream.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, but in their last interaction, after deleting the first 5 cards, they did another search_for_content, which created a new temporary collection. Then they tried to list_cards on that new one while still in the previous stream, causing the error. So maybe the solution is not to create a new temporary collection but to continue processing the existing one.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Alternatively, perhaps the user should have processed all chunks from the first search before doing another search. Since each call to list_cards_temporary_collection returns a chunked stream, they need to handle each chunk sequentially.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In this case, after the initial search_for_content created a temporary collection with the relevant cards, they would need to call list_cards_temporary_collection on that collection, process each batch of 5 cards, delete them one by one, and continue until all are deleted. However, since the user is trying to delete all at once, maybe there's a better way.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But given the system's constraints, the only way is to use search_for_content, get the temporary collection, list all cards in chunks, then for each chunk, delete the cards individually. Since the user can't abort the stream, they have to proceed with the existing one.\n",
    "#\n",

    "# Okay, the user wants to delete all cards that are mainly about object-oriented concepts. Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# First, I need to find those cards. Since the query is about a concept rather than specific keywords, using search_for_content makes sense. That function uses an LLM to evaluate if the card's content relates to the given topic.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# I should check all decks because the user didn't specify which one. The deck_id_str can be '*' for all decks. The search_prompt would be \"object-oriented concepts\". I need to search in both question and answer, so set search_in_question and search_in_answer to True.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Once the temporary collection is created, I need to add all those cards to it. Then, I have to delete each card in that collection. But how? The functions available allow deleting a card by its ID. However, if there are many cards, I might need to process them in chunks.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Wait, the temporary collection can be listed in chunks. So after creating the temporary collection, I should list the cards in it. For each chunk, get the card IDs and delete them one by one. But the user's instruction is to delete all, so I need to make sure all are processed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But first, let's start with creating the temporary collection using search_for_content. Let me check the parameters again: deck_id_str is '*', search_prompt is \"object-oriented concepts\", search_in_question and search_in_answer both True. That should gather all relevant cards.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Once that's done, I can proceed to delete each card in the temporary collection. However, I need to handle each card individually since there's no bulk delete function. So, after obtaining the list of cards from the temporary collection, loop through each card ID and call delete_card for each.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# But how do I get the card IDs? The list_cards_temporary_collection function returns a ChunkedCardStream, which gives batches of 5 cards. For each batch, extract the card IDs and delete them. Repeat until all chunks are processed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# So the steps are: search_for_content to create the temp collection, then list its cards in chunks, then delete each card. But I need to execute these steps one by one, as the system processes each function call.\n",
